<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>George Igbinogun</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is George, im a passionate Front-End Developer with expertise in web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I’m passionate about building beautiful and functional websites that deliver a great user experience. I am an enthusiastic individual that has an interest and an open mind to learn more from others and their different perspectives. I am 18 years old, in my spare time I like to research about the latest trends in the world of Automation. I am really interested in how websites are create and what could be done to improve the websites and their securities. I am always looking forward for something that will give me a challenge not because of the outcome of it but because of the process, I enjoy going through difficult processes, because it will make me learn a lot of things, which would make me realise where I am going wrong which is great for self-improvement. 
    I am currently learning more and more about front end development and the skills that I would need to have to be able to have to create a website, I have learned about elicitation techniques and how I would need them to gather information for website creation or website changes. </p>
